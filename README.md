Shipt Coding Challenge
======================
This webpage is to respond to the Shipt coding challenge for the Web Developer Intern position at the Birmingham HQ. Below in my Readme section I describe how to run this on a local machine in development mode and how I push to a remote after a story has been implemented fully. I will be doing this so that the dev staff at Shipt can see my standard workflow and adjust practices if required
